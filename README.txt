The code used to run the mixing models has been designed by Andrew Parnell. 

The models are bayesian mixing models and have been run with one or two isotopes (carbon alone or carbon and sulphur). 

Source indicator species were used as sources in the mixing model and no trophic fractionation was used within the model. Instead analyses were run with both with and without a trophic correction in order to compare results.
